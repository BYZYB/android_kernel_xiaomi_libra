Introduction
============

The qca1530 driver is required for configuration and control of qca1530 SoC
hardware. The driver does not connect to the chip itself, however it provides
control of reset line, power, clock and xLNA (external low-noise amplifier)
facilties. Driver also exports control interface to user space.

qca1530 is a System on Chip that enables GNSS position computation. The chip
holds firmware for satellite signal reception and preprocessing. Usually the
chip interfaces with serial or i2c interface. For proper operation, the chip
might require optional configuration of power regulator, xLNA, clock and reset
line.

Hardware description
====================

The hardware requires serial or i2c connection, power supply, clock and reset
line. In case xLNA is available, xLNA must be also configured.

Software description
====================

When configured, the driver initializes GPIOs, clock, and power supplies for
proper chip operation.

Typical scenario:

* Configure Reset GPIO
* Configure RTC clock GPIO/power supply
* Configure xLNA power supply
* Configure qca1530 chip power supply

After successful loading, the driver exports chip control functionality to
user space (described below).

In case of configuration error, driver releases acquired resources and fails
to load.

In case of error while performing service call from user space, driver signals
error condition to client application.

Design
======

Design goal is to provide flexible driver that can adapt to various hardware
platforms and provide stable user space control interface for the following
tasks:

* Controlling reset
* Controlling power
* Controlling RTC
* Controlling xLNA

The driver uses ARM DTS configuration for all items except RTC. The following
APIs are used:

* Power regulator consumer API
* GPIO API
* Clock consumer API
* sysfs

Power Management
================

Driver can control power for the following components:

* qca1530 chip
* RTCs
* xLNA

When loading, driver configures and turns on power supply for all components.
User space software may alter power supplies via interface.

Interface
=========

User with sufficient priviledges can perform following tasks:

* Control the reset line (on/off)
* Control power supply (on/off)
* Control RTC (on/off)
* Control xLNA (on/off)
* Query status of any of the controlled items

The following sysfs nodes are provided at /sys/class/gnss/qca1530:

reset: This node is used to control and query the chip reset state.
Valid values are: 0 - reset is off, 1 - reset is on.

power: This node is used to control and query the chip power supply.
Possible values are: 0 - off, 1 - on.

rtc: This node is used to control and query RTC clock (SLEEP_CLK) and TCXO
inputs. Possible values are: 0 - off, 1 - on.

xlna: This node is used to control and query xLNA facility. Possible values
are: 0 - off, 1 - on.

If the control for particular item is not available, the respective sysfs node
is not present.

Driver parameters
=================

No module or kernel command line parameters supported.

Config options
==============

This driver is enabled using the CONFIG_QCA1530 kernel config option.

Dependencies
============

In case required, GPIO, RTC and Power Regulator modules must be present.

To do
=====

* Separate driver into platform-specific option and userspace interface part.
Platform-specific part will contain platform integration code and provide
internal interface for controlling qca1530. The common part will contain user
space interface implementation.
* Add voltage/current control options. Currently driver expects power supply
to be preconfigured with proper voltage and current options. For better power
management the driver will also need to support entering low-power mode.
* Add clock configuration support via DTS.
