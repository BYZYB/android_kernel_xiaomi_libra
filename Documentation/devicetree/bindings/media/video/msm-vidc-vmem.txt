* Qualcomm Technologies Inc MSM VIDC VMEM

Required properties:
- compatible : "qcom,msm-vmem"
- interrupts : Contains the interrupt that maps to the VMEM module
- reg : A set of 2 start address and size pairs that describe the hardware
register address space and mappable memory address space.
- reg-names : Strings that describe the pairs in "reg".  The register address
space should be called "reg-base" and the memory space should be called "mem-base".
- clocks : A set of clocks that correspond to the AHB and MAXI clocks that the
hardware uses.
- clock-names : A string that describes the "clocks" property.  The AHB clock
should be named "ahb" and the MAXI clock should be named "maxi".
- qcom,banks : The number of memory banks that the hardware supports.

Example:

qcom,vmem@880000 {
	compatible = "qcom,msm-vmem";
	interrupts = <0 429 0>;
	reg = <0x880000 0x800>,
	    <0x6800000 0x100000>;
	reg-names = "reg-base", "mem-base";

	clocks = <&clock_mmss clk_vmem_ahb_clk>,
	       <&clock_mmss clk_vmem_maxi_clk>;
	clock-names = "ahb", "maxi";
	qcom,banks = <4>;
};
