QTI LiQUID Docking Station

This device describes the interface used when connecting a Qualcomm
Technology LiQUID Mobile Development Platform to its docking station.
This particular device describe's the dock's USB hub and Ethernet ports.
The interface consists of GPIOs used for controlling the main power
supply and reset lines.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "qcom,liquid-dock". "qcom,apq8084-dock" is
	       also supported but deprecated.
 - qcom,dock-detect-gpio: phandle to a GPIO node corresponding to the input
                         signal indicating when the dock is connected
 - qcom,usb-host: phandle to the USB host controller connected to the dock port

Optional properties:
 - qcom,dock-enable-gpio: phandle to a GPIO node corresponding to the output
                         signal that turns on/off power to the ports
 - qcom,dock-hub-reset-gpio: phandle to a GPIO node corresponding to the output
                            signal that resets the USB ports
 - qcom,dock-eth-reset-gpio: phandle to a GPIO node corresponding to the output
                            signal that resets the Ethernet ports
