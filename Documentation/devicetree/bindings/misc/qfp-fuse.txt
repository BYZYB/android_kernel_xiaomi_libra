* QFP-FUSE

The qfp-fuse entry specifies the memory mapped addresses for the QFPROM fuse
registers. The qfpfuse driver uses these to provide api(s) that can be used
to read and write the fuse values. The write operation can be done one time
only.

Required Properties:
compatible: component name used for driver matching, should be "qcom,qfp-fuse"
reg: physical base address and length of the register set

Optional Properties:
- qcom,blow-status-offset: offset of the blow status registers.
  The default offset is 0x204C. Include this only if the blow status register
  is at the different offset.
- qcom,blow-timer: blow timer value.
  The value specifies the blow time in number of blow timer clock cycles.
  The default setting is 0xF0. It meets the requirement for 28nm HPm fuse
  technology with blow timer clock at 19.2Mhz (12us blow time).
  Specify this only if the fuse blow time is different. The following are the
  recommended settings:
  - 0x280 (10us) for 45nm LP technology with 64Mhz blow timer clock
  - 0x100 (4us)  for 28nm LP technology with 64Mhz blow timer clock
  - 0x1E  (12us) for 28nm LP technology with 2.5Mhz blow timer clock

Example:
	qcom,qfpfuse@fc4b8000 {
		compatible = "qcom,qfp-fuse";
		reg = <0xfc4b8000 0x7000>;
		qcom,blow-status-offset = 0x204c;
	};
