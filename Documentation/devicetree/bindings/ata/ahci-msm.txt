* Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) MSM SATA driver

SATA nodes are defined to describe on-chip AHCI SATA host controllers.
Each SATA controller instance should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible        : compatible list, contains "qcom,msm-ahci"
- interrupts        : <interrupt mapping for AHCI host controller IRQ>
- reg               : <registers mapping>
- phys              : refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-bindings.txt
- phy-names         : refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-bindings.txt

Optional properties:
- clocks                : List of phandle and clock specifier pairs
- clock-names           : List of clock input name strings sorted in the same
                          order as the clocks property.
- max-clock-frequency-hz : List of maximum operating frequency stored in the same
                           order as the clocks property. If this property is not
			   defined or a value in the array is "0" then it is assumed
			   that the frequency is set by the parent clock or a
			   fixed rate clock source.
Note: If above properties are not defined it can be assumed that the clocks are always on.

Example:
	sata@0xfc580000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-ahci";
		reg = <0xfc580000 0x400>;
		interrupts = <0 31 0>;

		phys = <&sataphy0>;
		phy-names = "sata-6g";
		clocks = <&core 0>, <&iface 0>, <&pmalive 0>,
				<&rxoob0 0>, <&asic0 0>, <&rbc0 0>;
		clock-names = "core_clk", "iface_clk", "pmalive_clk",
				"rxoob_clk", "asic0_clk", "rbc0_clk";
		max-clock-frequency-hz = <0 0 100000000
					100000000 300000000 300000000>;
	};
