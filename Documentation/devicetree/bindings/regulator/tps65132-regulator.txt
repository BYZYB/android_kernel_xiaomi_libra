TPS65132 Voltage Regulators

Required properties:
  - compatible:		Must be "ti,tps65132"
  - reg:		I2C slave address

Required nodes:
  - regulators: 	A node that contains child nodes for each regulator in the
			device. Each sub-node is identified using the node's name.
			Supported regulator sub-node names: pos-boost and neg-boost

Optional properties:
  - vin-supply:		The phandle of the parent regulator that supplies the power to
			the chip
  - i2c-pwr-supply:	The power supply for i2c bus pull-up resistors
  - pinctrl-names:	The state name of the pin configuration. Only
			support: "default"
  - pinctrl-0:		The phandles of the pin configuration node in
			pinctrl for EN-pins.
			For details of pinctrl properties, please refer to:
			"Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt"
  - ti,en-gpio-lpm:	A boolean flag to indicate if the enable pin is configured
			to low power mode (LPM) when the output is disabled.

Regulator child node required properties:
  - regulator-name:	A string used as a descriptive name for the regulator
  - regulator-min-microvolt:
  - regulator-max-microvolt:
			The smallest and largest voltage that regulator can
			support.
			The supported values for regulator-min-microvolts and
			regulator-max-microvolt are 4000000 to 6000000 uV in
			100000 uV steps.
  - ti,en-gpio:		The gpio pin used for enabling the regulator output

Regulator child node optional properties:
  - ti,discharge-enable:A boolean flag to indicated if the regulator will
			be actively discharged to ground when it is disabled
  - ti,current-limit: 	Regulator output current limit in microamps
			 Supported values:
			    for pos-boost: 200000 only
			    for neg-boost: 40000 or 80000
			 If this property is not specified, then the current
			 limit for positive boost regulator is 200000uA and
			 for negative boost regulator is 40000uA.
  - ti,enable-time:	Time in us to delay after enabling the regulator. If
			this property is not present, a default value 800
			microseconds delay will be applied.
  - regulator-always-on:
  - regulator-boot-on:
			These properties are defined in core regulator framework. These
			bindings can be found in regulator.txt.

Example:

tps65132@3e {
	compatible = "ti,tps65132";
	reg = <0x3e>;
	i2c-pwr-supply = <&pm8916_l6>;

	regulators {
		tps65132_pos: pos-boost {
			regulator-name  = "tps65132_pos";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <5400000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <5400000>;
			ti,discharge-enable;
			ti,enable-time = <800>;
			ti,current-limit = <200000>;
			ti,en-gpio = <&msm_gpio 97 0>;
		};

		tps65132_neg: neg-boost {
			regulator-name = "tps65132_neg";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <5400000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <5400000>;
			ti,discharge-enable;
			ti,enable-time = <800>;
			ti,current-limit = <40000>;
			ti,en-gpio = <&msm_gpio 32 0>;
		};
	};
};
