== Introduction ==

In case of multiple external socs each exposing more than one interface to a
primary SOC, it is possible for the different interface drivers/clients to
expect notifications regarding the state of the external soc that they are
interested in. In some cases clients may need notifications of the status of
multiple external socs. The bindings referred to below enable a client device
to register for notifications from multiple external socs.

== Esoc client devices ==

For each esoc client device, every external soc that it is associated with, is
assigned an integer id. These ids start at 0 and are contiguous. Each id
represents a unique external soc. Each external soc is additionally assigned a
name. An additional property is used to spcify the names. A mapping is
performed from the name to the id.

Required properties:
esoc-0:		A phandle pointing to the esoc node that the esoc client is
		interested in.

esoc-names:	A list of string names for all the esocs that a given client
		is interested in. Must have atleast one name corresponding to
		esoc-0.

Optional properties:
esoc-1:		A phandle to the external soc, mapping to the second name in
		esoc-names.
...
esoc-n:		A phandle to the nth external soc mapping to the nth name in
		the esoc-names

== Example ==

esoc_a {
	compatible = "esoc_mdm";
	....
	...
	..
};

esoc_b {
	compatible = "esoc_wlan";
	..
	..
};

pcie@0x0001 {
	compatible = "esoc-pcie-client"
	....
	..
	..
	esoc-names = "mdm", "wlan";
	esoc-0 = <&esoc_a>;
	esoc-1 = <&esoc_b>;
	..
	..
};
