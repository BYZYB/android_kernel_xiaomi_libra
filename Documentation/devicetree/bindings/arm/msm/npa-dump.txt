* NPA Dump

RPM maintains the shared resources using the Node Power Architecture (NPA)
framework. The framework aggregates requests from different clients for a
resource and determines the final value. The NPA framework also provides an
option to log a snapshot of the resource active values and the client
requests. RPM provides a command to initiate and log this snapshot in the
shared ram

The required properties for npa-dump are:

- compatible: "qcom,npa-dump".
- reg: The address on RPM RAM from where the start address of log to be read.
       The second tuple would be the start of the RPM address and the size of
       the log.

Example:

	qcom,npa-dump@0xfc190020 {
		compatible = "qcom,npa-dump";
		reg = <0xfc190020 0x4>, <0xfc000000 0x1c00>;
	};
