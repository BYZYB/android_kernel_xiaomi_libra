KLM - Key Ladder Module

KLM is a HW module which generates and decrypt keys in a secured manner.
The KLM transfers generated keys securely into TSPP2 Key Table.

The devicetree representation of the KLM block should be:

Required properties:

- compatible: "qcom,klm"
- reg: physical memory base addresses and sizes for the following:
	KLM, TSPP2, BCSS_HLOS, BCSS_KLM.
- reg-names: names of the memory regions:
	MSM_KLM, MSM_BCSS_TSPP2, MSM_BCSS_HLOS, MSM_BCSS_KLM
- vdd-supply: power regulator (GDSC) supplying power to the broadcast subsystem.

Example:

	klm: msm-klm@fc560000 {
		compatible = "qcom,klm";
		reg = <0xfc560000 0x1000>, /* KLM registers */
		      <0xfc724000 0x7000>, /* TSPP2 registers */
		      <0xfc747000 0x1000>, /* KLM debug mode */
		      <0xfc748200 0x100>;  /* Key Tables */
		reg-names = "MSM_KLM", "MSM_BCSS_TSPP2", "MSM_BCSS_HLOS", "MSM_BCSS_KLM";
		vdd-supply = <&gdsc_bcss>;
	};
