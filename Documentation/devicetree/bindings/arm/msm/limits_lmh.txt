Limits Mangement Hardware driver
================================
LMH driver provides API to interact with the LMH hardware. All the calls to
the LMH hardware are routed via secure space.

The device tree parameters for LMH driver are:

Required parameters:
- compatible:	Must be "qcom,lmh"

- interrupts : LMH Lite hardware interrupt details.
- reg : Base address of the LMH Lite hardwares interrupt status register
		and its size in bytes.
- qcom,lmh-trim-err-offset : This property defines the bit in the LMH
		interrupt status register, which shows whether there is a
		trim error in LMH hardware.

Example:

qcom,lmh {
	compatible = "qcom,lmh";
	interrupts = <0 332 4>;
	reg = <0xF9117000 0x4>;
	qcom,lmh-trim-err-offset = <18>;
};
