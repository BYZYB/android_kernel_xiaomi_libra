* MSM Perfmap interface for performance monitors

Perfmap provides mapping of the base address for performance monitors and
allows user-space to access it via mmap call. It create a character device
driver which is accessed from user-space.

The required nodes for Perfmap are:

- compatible: "qcom,perfmap"
- reg: base address and size of mapped area

Example:
	qcom,perfmap@0xfc330000 {
		compatible = "qcom,perfmap";
		reg = <0xfc330000 0x3000>;
	};
