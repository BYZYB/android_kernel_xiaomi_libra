   Required regs are:
	"core" : the QSCRATCH base register set
 - <supply-name>-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node
   Required "supply-name" examples are:
	"vdd" : vdd supply for HSPHY digital circuit operation

	"vdda33" : 3.3v supply for HSPHY
 - qcom,vdd-voltage-level: This property must be a list of three integer
   values (no, min, max) where each value represents either a voltage in
   microvolts or a value corresponding to voltage corner

Optional properties:
 - reg: Additional registers
	"tcsr" : top-level CSR register to be written during power-on reset
		 intialize the internal MUX that controls whether this PHY is
		 used with the USB3 or the USB2 controller.
	"phy_csr" : register region that contains additional PHY CSRs that
		    offer additional control apart from the QSCRATCH registers.
		    These handle functions such as controlling the internal
		    reference clock buffer and powering on/off the entire PHY.
 - vddcx-supply: phandle to VDDCX regulator powering digital circuitry
 - qcom,hsphy-init: Init value used to override HSPHY parameters into
   QSCRATCH register. This 32-bit value represents parameters as follows:
		bits 0-5   PARAMETER_OVERRIDE_A
		bits 6-12  PARAMETER_OVERRIDE_B
		bits 13-19 PARAMETER_OVERRIDE_C
		bits 20-25 PARAMETER_OVERRIDE_D
 - qcom,ext-vbus-id: If present, indicates that the PHY does not handle VBUS and ID changes.
 - qcom,vbus-valid-override: If present, indicates VBUS pin is not connected to
   the USB PHY and the controller must rely on external VBUS notification in
   order to manually enable the D+ pull-up resistor.
 - qcom,primary-phy: If present, indicates this is a secondary PHY and is
   dependent on the primary PHY referenced by this phandle.
 - qcom,set-pllbtune: If present, PLL tune is required in PHY initialization.

   If omitted, defaults to 1
 - qcom,sleep-clk-reset: If present, the HSUSB PHY sleep clock supports the clk_reset
   operation, and should be called during initialization.
 - qcom,vdda-force-on: If present, HW requires a workaround that forces 1.8V and 3.1V
		       regulator supplies to be left on even when PHY enters into
		       low power mode.
