MSM SuperSpeed USB3.0 SoC controller

Required properties :
- compatible : should be "qcom,dwc-usb3-msm"
- reg : offset and length of the register set in the memory map
	offset and length of the TCSR register for routing USB
	signals to either picoPHY0 or picoPHY1.
- interrupts: IRQ lines used by this controller
- interrupt-names : Interrupt resource entries are :
	"hs_phy_irq" : Interrupt from HS PHY for asynchronous events in LPM.
	"pwr_event_irq" : Interrupt to controller for asynchronous events in LPM.
	Used for SS-USB power events.
- <supply-name>-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node
  Required "supply-name" examples are:
	"vbus_dwc3" : vbus supply for host mode when DWC3 operating as DRD.
	This can be left as optional if "host-only-mode" is selected in the
	'dwc3' sub node for "DWC3-USB3 Core device".
	"vdda33" : 3.3V analog voltage supply is applied to remove Dp & Dm pull
	downs for proper USB charger detection by charger driver.

Optional properties :
- Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt" for
  below optional properties:
    - qcom,msm_bus,name
    - qcom,msm_bus,num_cases
    - qcom,msm_bus,num_paths
    - qcom,msm_bus,vectors
- interrupt-names : Optional interrupt resource entries are:
    "pmic_id_irq" : Interrupt from PMIC for external ID pin notification.
- qcom,charging-disabled: If present then battery charging using USB
  is disabled.
- qcom,skip-charger-detection: If present then charger detection using BC1.2
  is not supported and attached host should always be assumed as SDP.
- USB3_GDSC-supply : phandle to the globally distributed switch controller
  regulator node to the USB controller.
- qcom,dwc_usb3-adc_tm: Corresponding ADC_TM device's phandle to set recurring
		measurements on USB_ID channel when using ADC and receive
		notifications for set thresholds.
- qcom,dwc-usb3-msm-tx-fifo-size: If present, represents RAM size available for
		TX fifo allocation in bytes
- qcom,dwc-usb3-msm-qdss-tx-fifo-size: If present, represent RAM size available
		for TX fifo allocation in QDSS composition
- qcom,restore-sec-cfg-for-scm-dev-id: If present then device id value is
  passed to secure channel manager(scm) driver. scm driver uses this device
  id to restore USB controller related security configuration after coming
  out of the controller power collapse.
- qcom,utmi-clk-rate: Indicates refclk frequency (in Hz) to the core. If not
  specified, default of 19.2MHz is assumed.
- qcom,no-suspend-resume: If present, the device will not perform any activity
		during suspend/resume
- qcom,usb-dbm : phandle for the DBM device
- qcom,usbin-vadc: Corresponding vadc device's phandle to read usbin voltage using VADC.
	This will be used to get value of usb power supply's VOLTAGE_NOW property,
- qcom,power-collapse-on-cable-disconnect: If present, USB core will perform
	power collapse when cable is disconencted.
- qcom,por-after-power-collapse: If present, a partial POR sequence will be performed
  when recovering from power collapse.
- qcom,lpm-to-suspend-delay-ms: Indicates timeout (in milliseconds) to release wakeup source
  after USB is kept into LPM.
- qcom,vbus-present: Indicates that there is no VBUS indication from PMIC. Assume VBUS is
  present if this property is defined.
Sub nodes:
- Sub node for "DWC3- USB3 controller".
  This sub node is required property for device node. The properties of this subnode
  are specified in dwc3.txt.
