SMB349 Dual Charger

SMB349 Dual Charger is a single-path battery charger working
in conjunction with an additional external charger to hand-off
for HVDCP/WiPower charging on the same path.

The SMB349 charger interface is via I2C bus.
SMB349 suspend HW to HW signal is used to prevent charging while
HVDCP/WiPower charging is activated.

Required Properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,smb349-dual-charger".
- reg:				The device 7-bit I2C address.
- qcom,chg-stat-gpio		GPIO which indicates the charger presence
				by level, as well as special events by pulses
				of 10ms each 300ms until cleared.
- qcom,ext-psy-name		This is a string and it point to the external
				power supply name, SMB349 Dual Charger driver
				controls the hand-off to/from this external
				power supply

Optional Properties:

- qcom,fastchg-current-max-ma	Fast Charging current in mA. Supported range is
				from 1000mA to 4000mA.
- qcom,charging-disabled	This is a bool property which disables charging.

- qcom,bms-psy-name		This is a string and it points to the bms
				power supply name.
- qcom,iterm-ma			Specifies the termination current to indicate end-of-charge.
				Possible values in mA - 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700.
- qcom,iterm-disabled		Disables the termination current feature. This is a bool
				property.
- qcom,float-voltage-mv	 	Float Voltage in mV - the maximum voltage up to which
				the battery is charged. Supported range 3460mV to 4720mV
- qcom,recharge-mv		Recharge threshold in mV - the offset from the float-volatge
				as which the charger restarts charging. Possible
				values are 50mV and 100mV.
- qcom,recharge-disabled	Boolean value which disables the auto-recharge.

Example:
	i2c@f9967000 {
		smb349-dual-charger@1b {
			compatible = "qcom,smb349-dual-charger";
			reg = <0x1b>;
			interrupt-parent = <&spmi_bus>;
			qcom,chg-stat-gpio = <&pm8994_gpios 6 0x1>;
			qcom,fastchg-current-max-ma = <2000>;
			qcom,battery-psy-name = "cradle-charger";
			qcom,ext-psy-name = "battery";
		};
	};
