QPNP External USB VBUS Detection Circuit

Discrete USB VBUS detection circuitry can be connected to Qualcomm PMICs.
Such circuits can be used to detect the when a USB cable is connected to
an upstream port such as a standard host or a wall charger by detecting
the presence of VBUS voltage. The PMIC is notified by a detection event
via SPMI bus interrupt. A software driver can in turn notify the USB
subsytem using the power_supply framework.

Required Properties:
 - compatible: must be "qcom,qpnp-usbdetect"
 - interrupts: an interrupt triggered by the output of the detection circuit
 - interrupt-names: must be "vbus_det_irq"

Optional Properties:
 - vin-supply: phandle to a regulator that powers this circuit, if needed

Example:

	usb_detect {
		compatible = "qcom,qpnp-usbdetect";
                interrupt-parent = <&spmi_bus>;
                interrupts = <0x0 0xCA 0x0>;  /* PMA8084 GPIO 11 */
                interrupt-names = "vbus_det_irq";
                vin-supply = <&vbus_det_reg>;
	};
