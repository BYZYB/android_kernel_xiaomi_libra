QCA1530 SoC

QCA1530 is a SoC for position determination using navigation satellites.
Typical scenario includes usage of GPS and GLONASS satellite navigation
systems.

Required properties

- compatible: "qca,qca1530"

Optional properties
- qca,pwr-supply: handle to the regulator device tree node
- qca,pwr2-supply: handle to additional regulator device tree node
- qca,pwr-gpio: handle the power control using GPIO interface
- qca,reset-gpio: GPIO for reset control
- qca,reset-supply: handle to the regulator for reset control
- qca,clk-gpio: handle the clock control using GPIO interface
- qca,xlna-supply: handle to the regulator for xLNA
- qca,xlna-gpio: handle to xLNA power control using GPIO interface
- qca,xlna-voltage-level: list containing minimum and maximum voltage
                          levels for xlna regulator
- qca,xlna-current-level: list containing current values for active
                          operation and sleep modes

Example:
	 gnss_qca1530: qca,qca1530{
		compatible = "qca,qca1530";
		qca,pwr-supply = <&pma8084_l26>;
		qca,reset-gpio = <&msmgpio 128 0>;
		qca,xlna-supply = <&pma8084_l22>;
		qca,xlna-voltage-level = <3000000 3000000>;
		qca,xlna-current-level = <90000 100>;
	};
