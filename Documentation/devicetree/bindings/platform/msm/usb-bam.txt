MSM USB Bus Access Manager (BAM)

This describes the device used to interface the USB controller
with the Smart Peripheral Subsystem (SPS). The BAM serves to
connect USB directly with other peer peripherals in the system
and is statically configured with a number of unidirectional pipes.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "qcom,usb-bam-msm"
- reg  : pairs of physical base addresses and region sizes
            of all the memory mapped BAM devices present
- reg-names : Register region name(s), in 1-1 correspondence with the
	    registers in 'reg'. This list should contain at least as many names
            as the number of unique values given in both 'usb-active-bam' and
            all the subnodes' 'usb-bam-type' properties.

            If SSUSB_BAM is used, "ssusb" should be present.
            If HSUSB_BAM is used, "hsusb" should be present.
            If HSIC_BAM is used, "hsic" should be present.

            If a QSCRATCH RAM1 register is designated for providing USB3
            private memory to use as a BAM FIFO, specify "qscratch_ram1_reg".
- interrupts: IRQ lines for BAM devices
- interrupt-names: BAM interrupt name(s), in 1-1 correspondence with
            'interrupts' above.

            If SSUSB_BAM is used, "ssusb" should be present.
            If HSUSB_BAM is used, "hsusb" should be present.
            If HSIC_BAM is used, "hsic" should be present.
- qcom,usb-bam-num-pipes: max number of pipes that can be used

Optional properties:
- qcom,usb-bam-fifo-baseaddr: base address for bam pipe's data and descriptor
  fifos. This can be on chip memory (ocimem) or usb private memory. This
  property is required if sub-node's mem-type is ocimem or usb private mem.

A number of USB BAM pipe parameters are represented as sub-nodes:

Subnode Required:
- label: a string describing uniquely the usb bam pipe. The string can be
  constracted as follows: <core>-<peer>-<direction>-<pipe num>.
	core options: hsusb, ssusb/dwc3, hsic
	peer options: qdss, ipa, a2
	direction options: in (from peer to usb), out (from usb to peer)
	pipe num options: 0..127
- qcom,usb-bam-mem-type: Type of memory used by this PIPE. Can be one of
            0 - Uses SPS's dedicated pipe memory
            1 - USB's private memory residing @ 'qcom,usb-bam-fifo-baseaddr'
            2 - System RAM allocated by driver
	    3 - OCI memory residing @ 'qcom,usb-bam-fifo-baseaddr'
- qcom,bam-type: BAM type can be one of
	0 - SSUSB_BAM
	1 - HSUSB_BAM
	2 - HSIC_BAM
- qcom,dir: pipe direction
	0 - from usb (out)
	1 - to usb (in)
- qcom,pipe-num: pipe number
- qcom,peer-bam: peer BAM can be one of
	0 - A2_P_BAM
	1 - QDSS_P_BAM
	2 - IPA_P_BAM
- qcom,data-fifo-size: data fifo size
- qcom,descriptor-fifo-size: descriptor fifo size

Optional Properties for Subnode:
- qcom,reset-bam-on-connect: If present then BAM is RESET before connecting
  pipe. This may be required if BAM peripheral is also reset before connect.
- qcom,dst-bam-physical-address: destination BAM physical address
- qcom,dst-bam-pipe-index: destination BAM pipe index
- qcom,src-bam-physical-address: source BAM physical address
- qcom,src-bam-pipe-index: source BAM pipe index
- qcom,data-fifo-offset: data fifo offset address
- qcom,descriptor-fifo-offset: descriptor fifo offset address
- qcom,pipe-connection-type: type of pipe connection. Can be one of
	0 - BAM2BAM (default if not specified)
	1 - SYS2BAM (only supported on UL)

Optional properties :
- qcom,bam-mode: BAM mode can be one of.
	0 - BAM_MODE_DEVICE
	1 - BAM_MODE_HOST
	(If not set will be set by default to BAM_MODE_DEVICE)
- qcom,ignore-core-reset-ack: If present then BAM ignores ACK from USB core
	    while performing PIPE RESET
- qcom,disable-clk-gating: If present then disable BAM clock gating.
- qcom,usb-bam-override-threshold: If present then the default 512 byte threshold
		is overriden. This threshold configures the threshold value for Read/Write
		event generation by the BAM towards another BAM.
- qcom,usb-bam-max-mbps-highspeed: max mbps in high speed connection
            for either rx or tx direction.
- qcom,usb-bam-max-mbps-superspeed: max mbps in super speed connection
            for either rx or tx direction.
