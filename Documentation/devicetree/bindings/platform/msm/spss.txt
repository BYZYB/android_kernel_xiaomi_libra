MSM Standby Processing Sub-System (SPSS) Controller

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "qcom,msm-spss"
- reg : Offset and length of the register region for the device
- reg-names : Register region name referenced in 'reg' above
	The only required register resource entry is:
	"base"       : SPSS controller register block

The SPSS device may optionally have either or both of GENI-IR and
HDMI-CEC devices as the child devices.

The address-cells, size-cells and ranges properties ensure that the SPSS child
devices are properly enumerated.

Example:
	qcom,msm-spss@fc5c3000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;
		compatible = "qcom,msm-spss";
		reg-names = "base";
		reg = <0xfc5c3000 0x1000>;

		geni_ir_1: qcom,msm-geni-ir@fc5c1000 {

		...

		};
	};
