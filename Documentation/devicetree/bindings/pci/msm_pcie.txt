  - qcom,l0s-supported: L0s is supported.
  - qcom,l1-supported: L1 is supported.
  - qcom,l1ss-supported: L1 sub-states (L1ss) is supported.
  - qcom,aux-clk-sync: The AUX clock is synchronous to the Core clock to
    support L1ss.
  - qcom,common-clk-en: Enables the common clock configuration for the endpoint.
  - qcom,clk-power-manage-en: Enables the clock power management for the
    endpoint.
  - qcom,n-fts: The number of fast training sequences sent when the link state
    is changed from L0s to L0.
  - qcom,ep-wakeirq: The endpoint will issue wake signal when it is up, and the
    root complex has the capability to enumerate the endpoint for this case.
  - qcom,msi-gicm-addr: MSI address for GICv2m.
  - qcom,msi-gicm-base: MSI IRQ base for GICv2m.
  - qcom,ext-ref-clk: The reference clock is external.
  - qcom,vbg-opt: The vbg optimization is supported.
  - qcom,ep-latency: The time (unit: ms) to wait for the PCIe endpoint to become
    stable after power on, before de-assert the PERST to the endpoint.
  - qcom,tlp-rd-size: The max TLP read size (Calculation: 128 times 2 to the
    tlp-rd-size power).
  - Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt" for
    below optional properties:
	- qcom,msm-bus,name
	- qcom,msm-bus,num-cases
	- qcom,msm-bus,num-paths
	- qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps
  - qcom,scm-dev-id: If present then device id value is passed to secure channel
	manager(scm) driver. scm driver uses this device id to restore PCIe
	controller related security configuration after coming out of the controller
	power collapse.
