* MSM Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) PHY

SATA PHY nodes are defined to describe on-chip SATA PHY hardware macro.
To bind SATA PHY with SATA host controller, the controller node should
contain a phandle reference to SATA PHY node.
Refer to generic phy bindings @
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-bindings.txt

Required properties:
- compatible        : compatible list, contains "qcom,sataphy"
- reg               : <registers mapping>
- reg-names         : corresponding register space names
			"phy_mem" is mandatory
			"phy_sel" is optional and is required only for UFS-SATA combo phy
- #phy-cells        : shall be set to 0.
- vdda-phy-supply   : phandle to main PHY supply for analog domain
- vdda-pll-supply   : phandle to PHY PLL and Power-Gen block power supply

Optional properties:
- vdda-phy-max-microamp : specifies max. load that can be drawn from phy supply
- vdda-pll-max-microamp : specifies max. load that can be drawn from pll supply

Example:

	sataphy0: sataphy@0xfc597000 {
		compatible = "qcom,sataphy";
		reg = <0xfc581000 0x400>, <0xfd4ab20c 0x4>;
		reg-names = "phy_mem", "phy_sel";
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		vdda-phy-supply = <&pma8084_l4>;
		vdda-pll-supply = <&pma8084_l12>;
		vdda-phy-max-microamp = <50000>;
		vdda-pll-max-microamp = <1000>;
	};

	sata@0xfc598000 {
		...
		phys = <&sataphy0>;
		phy-names = "sata-6g";
	};
